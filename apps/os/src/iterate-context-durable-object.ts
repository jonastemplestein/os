// iterate-context-durable-object.ts — `IterateContextDurableObject`: THE CONTEXT, one DO per
// `{projectId, path}` (codec-named `{projectId}.iterate{path}`), the parent of everything a context
// holds: the stream with its core reduce (stream/stream.ts), subscription delivery
// (stream/subscription-delivery.ts), the facets (context/facet-host.ts over `ctx.facets` and
// context/worker-loader.ts), the rpc stubs (context/rpc-stubs.ts), what ends its residency when
// nothing should hold it (context/residency.ts), and `fetch()` (the pager upgrade, HTTP requests,
// egress). Each module's header says what it does; this file is the wiring and the entry points.
//   egress — `#egress`: a `getSecret("/secrets/NAME")` request is forwarded to the context at that path, whose `secret` facet substitutes and dispatches (secret/durable-object.ts)
//
// PURE WORKERS-RPC: capnweb never terminates here — the stateless `/api` worker relays. Dispatch is
// ONE method, `invoke(call)`; every OTHER change to this context is an appended event (the edge's
// `provide`/`subscribe` and the `processors` root build one and call `append`; a lent stub's rule or
// row rides its pager upgrade and is appended as the pager is accepted) — there are no
// configuration verbs here. The events this class appends on its own initiative: the birth and wake
// records (Stream.appendBirthRecord / appendWakeRecord — the wake record also settles, `interrupted`,
// every run the last incarnation left open), a due schedule's batch (`alarm`), a requested run's
// settlement (`#executeRun` — the runner section) and the un-set of whatever named an rpc stub whose
// last pager closed (onPresence); alarm diagnostics are ephemeral traces. The effects it runs off a
// fresh commit (`#appendAndRunCommittedEffects`): deleting the facet a removed subscription hosted and
// refreshing the startup memo of the facet a hosting subscription configures; off every commit
// (`onCommit`) delivery, the requested runs, and un-setting what names an rpc stub a woken or
// resumed stream finds dead.
