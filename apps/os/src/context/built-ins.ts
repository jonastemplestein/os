// built-ins.ts — THE BUILT-INS: a plain record whose KEYS are the physical-layer roots (the one list
// is context/itx-expression-rewriting.ts). Three kinds of key, one record: the AXIOMS (the log, the stub
// registry, the rule table, the two hosts, addressing), the BINDINGS (`kv`, `secrets`, `ai`,
// `browser`, `cfArtifacts`, `repos` — a Cloudflare binding only this env holds, exposed or scoped) and THE
// LIBRARY (`connectTo*`, library.ts — code a user could write, taking only `itx`).
// THE RECORD IS `itx.builtins`, the reserved root: `itx.builtins.<root>…` runs against it directly
// and never reads the rule table; a short `itx.<root>…` reaches it through the IMPLICIT PLATFORM ROW
// unless the context's own table says otherwise (itx-expression-rewriting.ts `implicitRootsAt`) — so a
// test may shadow `itx.ai`, a context may mask `itx.kv`, and `itx.builtins.…` always reaches the
// physical scope.
// Dynamic code has two entry points, one per host kind: `workers.get(spec)` (stateless) and
// `facets.get(name, spec)` (durable) — the `BuiltInScope` members below say what each takes.

 *  on a fresh stub; anything else fails, and an expression fetch answers a platform failure 503
 *  (iterate-context-durable-object.ts). A handle the context answers with (by expression,
 *  dispatch.ts) becomes one of this caller's own, so a handle held here is one whole call per verb,
 *  never a session held open. The context is acquired PER CALL (`contextOf`): a stub that saw a
